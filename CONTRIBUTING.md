# Contributing to The Useless Button

Thank you for your interest in contributing to this beautifully pointless project! While the application is intentionally useless, we welcome contributions that make it even more delightfully chaotic.

## üéØ Project Philosophy

This project embraces the art of beautiful uselessness. When contributing, keep these principles in mind:

- **Chaos over Order**: Features should add delightful unpredictability
- **Beauty in Pointlessness**: Even useless features should be well-crafted
- **User Confusion**: If users understand what's happening, we're doing it wrong
- **Technical Excellence**: Just because it's useless doesn't mean it should be poorly built

## üöÄ Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub
2. Clone your fork locally (if working outside of the browser environment)
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`
4. Start the development server: `npm run dev`
5. Create your changes in a new branch

## üé® Types of Contributions

### New Chaos Events
Add new random events to the chaos engine:
- Visual effects (animations, color changes, etc.)
- Audio effects (new sounds, musical chaos)
- Interactive elements (spawning objects, UI mutations)
- Browser API abuse (notifications, vibrations, etc.)

### UI/UX Improvements
- Better animations and transitions
- More responsive design improvements
- Accessibility enhancements
- Mobile-specific chaos events

### Performance Optimizations
- Bundle size reductions
- Animation performance improvements
- Memory leak fixes
- Better state management

### Documentation
- Code comments explaining the chaos
- README improvements
- Contributing guide updates
- Deployment documentation

## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### TypeScript
- Use TypeScript for all new code
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use proper typing for all functions and variables
- Avoid `any` types unless absolutely necessary

### React
- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer `useCallback` and `useMemo` for performance
- Keep components small and focused
- Use proper prop typing

### CSS/Styling
- Use Tailwind CSS classes when possible
- Create custom CSS only when Tailwind isn't sufficient
- Follow mobile-first responsive design
- Use CSS animations for smooth transitions

### Code Organization
- Keep files under 200 lines when possible
- Use descriptive function and variable names
- Group related functionality together
- Add comments for complex chaos logic

## üß™ Testing

While this is a silly project, we still care about quality:

- Test new chaos events to ensure they work across browsers
- Verify responsive design on different screen sizes
- Check accessibility with screen readers
- Test performance with many spawned elements
- Confirm your project shows the 'Built with Bolt.new' badge

## üì¶ Pull Request Process

1. **Create a descriptive branch name**: `feature/rainbow-cursor-chaos`
2. **Write clear commit messages**: "Add rainbow cursor trail chaos event"
3. **Update documentation** if needed
4. **Test your changes** thoroughly
5. **Create a pull request** with:
   - Clear description of what you added
   - Screenshots/GIFs of the new chaos in action
   - Any breaking changes or dependencies
