# The Useless Button 🎪

A beautifully chaotic web application created for the Reddit Silly Shit Challenge. This project is the epitome of digital pointlessness - a button that does absolutely nothing useful, but does it with style.

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

The Useless Button is an interactive experience that rewards users with delightful chaos every time they click it. Each click triggers random events including:

- 🔊 Random sound effects using Web Audio API
- 🌈 Dynamic background pattern changes
- 📝 Button text transformations
- 🎭 Spawning random emojis across the screen
- 🎨 Font style mutations
- 📢 Useless fact alerts
- 🕵️ Secret console messages
