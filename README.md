# The Useless Button: Corrupted Edition 🎪💀

A beautifully chaotic web application that transforms the simple act of clicking a button into a reality-glitching nightmare. This project is the corrupted evolution of the original Useless Button, designed to make every click feel like a mistake you can't stop making.

## 🎯 What Does It Do?

The Useless Button: Corrupted Edition is an interactive experience that progressively breaks reality with each click. Every button press triggers increasingly absurd and frustrating effects:

### Basic Chaos (Every Click):
- 🔊 Random ridiculous sounds (farts, meows, clown horns, screams)
- 🌈 Terrible background color combinations that hurt your eyes
- 📝 Button text corruption and glitching
- 🎭 Spawning random animated elements across the screen
- 🎨 Font style mutations and text flipping
- 📢 Useless fact alerts and fake pop-ups
- 🕵️ Screen shaking and visual distortions

### Progressive Corruption:
- **10+ clicks**: Button starts dodging your mouse cursor
- **20+ clicks**: Button multiplies (2, then 3, then more buttons appear)
- **30+ clicks**: Spooky audio starts playing on loop
- **Hell Mode**: Optional chaos amplifier that adds CSS filters and maximum corruption
